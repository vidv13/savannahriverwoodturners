The Savannah River Woodturners Club was formed in 2008 with its first meetings at the home shops of George Stewart and Howard Moore. Both men have since been recognized as life time members for their guidance and inspiration during those first few months when the concept of a club was more dream than reality. The club continues to grow and has become affiliated with the American Woodturners Association.

Club Members share a common interest and pleasure in using the lathe to transform wood and other raw materials into forms that are practical in use or visually beautiful or both. At club meetings, discussions and demonstrations are held, members bring items they have made to present and acquire feedback and advice, and members enjoy the opportunity to network with others who share their love of woodturning.
