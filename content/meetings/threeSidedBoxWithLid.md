Our Presenter For January:
Dr. Evan Bahr

The Club had its first meeting for 2024 on a very cold and blustery day in east central Georgia. There were 14 club members in attendance and all watched as our presenter Dr. Evan Bahr demonstrated how to turn three sided boxes with matching lids. Everyone enjoyed the demonstration and learned a few new turning techniques. Come join us for our next meeting on the 17th of February 2024 at 09:00 AM.
